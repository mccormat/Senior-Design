Title: Apple Gobbler
-----------------------------------------------------

This project is lossely based on the traditional snake game, but with a twist:
	Instead of your tail growing larger as you gobble up more apples, obstacles appear in your way!

The game, accompanied by a lighthearted musical track in the background, is controlled
by the user swiping the snake head around the screen, gobbling up those shiny red apples as
fast as they can. Once they eat an apple, a new wall appears at random on the map. If the snake
collides with a wall, the game is over and their score is added to the high score table. In addition 
to the regular red apples, occasionaly a rainbow apple, a bright green apple, or a wall with an 'X' on it
will appear, which will perform special actions. The rainbow apple is the "speed apple", meaning it
will either slow you down, or speed you up significantly (be careful!). The green apple is the 
"points apple" meaning it will increase your total score by 4. The wall with the 'X' on it will
help you out by destroying 5 walls on the map.

And that is the jist of it. You can specify which difficulty you want to try (only the brave dare 
try King Cobra) in addition to seeing how you stack up to all the other snakes in the High Score table.

We made use of the Cocos2D libraries, and were aided by a tutorial in using the Cocos2D library we found online at:
